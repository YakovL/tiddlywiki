Putting ~TiddlyWiki on a USB stick lets you carry around a self contained notebook that you can update wherever there's a computer, whether it's a Mac, Linux or a PC. 

To be even more independent you can [[install FireFox on the drive|http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable]] as well!
