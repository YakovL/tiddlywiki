title: JavaScript
type: text/x-tiddlywiki

JavaScript is the programming language that powers the [[Web]]. In the browser it is used to script behaviours that breathe life into the static world of [[HTML]] and [[CSS]], and it is increasingly being selected as a ServerSide programming language.

TiddlyWiki relies on JavaScript, and can't function properly without it. An alternative is to use a ServerSide adaptation like TiddlyWeb or TiddlySpace that can provide a static HTML view of TiddlyWiki content that doesn't require JavaScript in the browser.
